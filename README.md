# Computer Animation

These laboratory assigement were completed as part of the *Computer Animation* course at college. They are implemented in C++, with use of OpenGL and GLM technologies.

**First laboratory assigement** (lab1): B-spline curve - demonstration of the use of B-splines for animating the path of an object over time, as well as animating the rotation of the object along the curve.

**Second laboratory assigement** (lab2): System of particles - snow simulation.

**Project** (lab3): Simple 2D game.
