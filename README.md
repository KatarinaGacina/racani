# Computer Animation

These laboratory assigements were completed as part of the Computer Animation course at college. They are implemented in C++, with use of OpenGL and GLM technologies.

## First laboratory assigement:  
B-spline curve - demonstration of the use of B-splines for animating the path of an object over time, as well as animating the rotation of the object along the curve.

## Second laboratory assigement:  
Particle System - snow simulation.

## Project (lab3):  
Simple 2D game.
